            <p class="live">My name is Irina, I'm 19 years old and my English is not that good...
                By education I am a teacher of German, with level B2, but I became interested in another "language". And now for a little over 5 months I have been learning JavaScript! 
                Of my strengths, I can single out perseverance and diligence - which allows me not to quit my studies, even when it is very difficult! I am also an open, active and very sociable person.
                I am ready to learn and learn new things, because I want to be useful!</p>
